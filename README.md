# DESCRIPTION :

As a task of CODTECH internship, I built a chrome extension .I aim to develop a Chrome extension that tracks user activity and display.

This Chrome extension helps users track how much time they spend on different websites. It shows which sites are visited the most and for how long. The tool also groups websites into productive (like coding or learning platforms) and unproductive (like social media).

It gives a clear summary of daily, weekly, and all-time activity, helping users manage their time better and stay focused.
